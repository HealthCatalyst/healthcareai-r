Description: Aims to make machine learning in healthcare as easy as possible. 
  You can develop customized, reliable, high-performance machine learning models with minimal code. 
  Models are created with automatic preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and
  algorithm selection (between 
  'xgboost' Chen, T. & Guestrin, C. (2016) <arXiv:1603.02754>,
  'ranger' Wright, M. N., & Ziegler, A. (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v077.i01>,
  and 'glmnet' Friedman J, Hastie T, Tibshirani R. (2010) <doi:10.18637/jss.v033.i01>) 
  so that they can be easily
  put into production. Additionally, there are tools to help understand how a model makes its 
  predictions, select prediction threshholds for operational use, and evaluate model performance over time.
  Code uses 'tidyverse' syntax and most methods have an associated visualization.
