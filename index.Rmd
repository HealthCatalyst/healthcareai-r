# Hello!

This is our pkgdown homepage, which is now distinct from our readme (by default README.md would be used here.)

This was auto-generated from an R Markdown file (`index.Rmd`), so we can do things like this:

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(healthcareai)

#### Example using Diabetes dataset ####
ptm <- proc.time()
# Can delete this line in your work
csvfile <- system.file("extdata", 
                       "HCRDiabetesClinical.csv", 
                       package = "healthcareai")
# Replace csvfile with 'your/path'
df <- read.csv(file = csvfile, 
               header = TRUE, 
               na.strings = c("NULL", "NA", ""))
head(df)
df$PatientID <- NULL

set.seed(42)
p <- UnsupervisedModelParams$new()
p$df <- df
p$impute <- TRUE
p$grainCol <- "PatientEncounterID"
p$debug <- FALSE
p$cores <- 1
p$numOfClusters <- 3

# Run k means clustering
cl <- KmeansClustering$new(p)
cl$run()

# Get the 2D representation of the cluster solution
```

```{r plot}
cl$get2DClustersPlot()
```
