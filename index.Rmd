# Hello!

This is our pkgdown homepage, which is now distinct from our readme (by default README.md would be used here.)

This was auto-generated from an R Markdown file (`index.Rmd`), so we can include code and its outcomes.

```{r}
library(healthcareai)
models <- machine_learn(pima_diabetes[1:100, ], outcome = diabetes)
plot(models)
```
