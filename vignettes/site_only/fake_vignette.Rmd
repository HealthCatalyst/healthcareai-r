# Greetings, Earthlings

I am a vignette. My source is a .Rmd file that lives in `vignettes/`. Vignettes that go in `vignettes/site_only/` will have a page in the pkgdown site, but will not be bundled with the R package

I can execute and display the results of R code:

```{r}
plot(density(rnorm(1000)))
```
