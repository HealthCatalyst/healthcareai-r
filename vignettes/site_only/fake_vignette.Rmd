# Greetings, Earthlings

I am a vignette. Because I'm in the `vignettes/site_only` directory, I will show up in the pkgdown site, but not be bundled with the R package, which is good since I'd only take up precious space there.

Note that I'm an R Markdown document:

```{r}
plot(density(rnorm(1000)))
```
