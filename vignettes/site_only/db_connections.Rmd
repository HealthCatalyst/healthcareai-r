Let's be honest. You need to get data from a database, do some really awesome 
stuff with `R`, and then write the results back to a database. RStudio (and R) 
can help with that. There are lots of different databases, but this document 
will focus on Microsoft SQL Server. RStudio supports most databases, and 
I'd encourage you to look at the [db help pages](https://db.rstudio.com/) 
for additional resources. Andiamo!

If you simply want a code snippet to copy and paste, scroll to the bottom.

# Connecting to a Database

Before you can do anything, you must make a connection to your database. The 
`build_connection_string` function takes care of the syntax for you and returns
a connection string that's ready to be passed into `dbConnect`. After
you have a valid connection, you should be able to browse the database using 
RStudio's Connections pane. If you don't have a connections pane, upgrade your 
RStudio. It's worth it.

```{r}
library(healthcareai)
library(DBI)

my_con <- build_connection_string(server = "HCS-GM0004",
                                  database = "SAM")
con <- dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), .connection_string = my_con)
```

Your database connection is now stored in the object, `con`. You can use it in 
database functions that require a connection. `dbConnect` will create a 
persistent connection, meaning that it's available until you disconnect. If you
have a recent version of RStudio, you'll see the connections pane has updated as
well.

```{r, out.width = "500px", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/conn_pane.png")
```

Each database, schema, and table is available as a drop down menu for 
exploration. Clicking the button in the far right column next to a table will
bring up a preview of the top 1000 rows of the table.

# Reading data

## Using SQL Code

From here, you can read data from the database in a couple different ways. You
can use `db_read` to execute SQL code, or you can use `dbplyr` functionality
to execute `dplyr` code directly against the database.
```{r}
query <- "SELECT
          ,COUNT(*),
          ,year(AdmitDT) as AdmitYear
          FROM [SAM].[Encounter].[PatientEncounterBASE]
          WHERE AdmitYear >= 2013
          GROUP BY AdmitYear
          ORDER BY AdmitYear"

d <- db_read(con, query)
```
This query counts admits by year. If you don't want to pull the results into
memory, as might the be the case with large tables, set the `pull_into_memory`
flag to FALSE. This will create a pointer to the database that can be 
executed "lazily." In other words R will wait until the last moment to execute 
the statement.

## Using dplyr Code

The other option is to use dplyr code. Set up a reference to the table, then use
it to pull data. Here, `tbl` is creating a reference and storing it in the 
`encounter` object. R will treat that object like a data frame and can
filter, aggregate, join, etc using R or dplyr code. The last line, `collect()`, 
is what actually pulls the data into memory. Be sure to first `install.packages('tidyverse')`

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

encounter <- tbl(con, in_schema("Encounter", "PatientEncounterBASE"))

d <- encounter %>%
  mutate(AdmitYear = year(AdmitDT)) %>%
  filter(AdmitYear >= 2013) %>%
  group_by(AdmitYear) %>%
  tally() %>%
  collect()
```

See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26611717/can-dplyr-join-on-multiple-columns-or-composite-key) 
for help with joins using dplyr.

# Writing Data
Note: the odbc/DBI route doesn't work as of 4/18

~~As of 4/1/2018, there are two ways to write to a database:~~

1. ~~The latest version of `odbc`, and `DBI`, 
installed from Github. The CRAN version does not support database schemas.~~

2. `RODBC`

In either case, the data you are trying to write must match the destination
table's column names and data types. To create the table, you use a `CREATE TABLE` statement in a tool like SSMS (or SAMD, if in the Health Catalyst environment).

This code assumes there is a table called `SAM.Sepsis.Predictions` with columns:

- patient_id (int)
- predicted_probability (float).

## ~~Writing with DBI~~

**Note: as of April 18th, DBI is not working for writing to a database**

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(DBI)
devtools::install_github("r-dbi/odbc")

predictions <- data.frame(patient_id = c(1,2,3),
                          predicted_readmission = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.4))

table_id <- Id(schema = "Sepsis", 
               name = "Predictions")

res <- dbWriteTable(conn = con,
                    name = table_id,
                    value = predictions,
                    append = TRUE)
dbDisconnect(con)
```

## Writing with RODBC

While it's the route that works (as of April 18th), RODBC won't be the preferred way to interact with a database long-term because it doesn't work with RStudio's connections pane. However, the package is available on CRAN and does support schemas.
```{r}
library(RODBC)
# Make a connection
my_con <- build_connection_string(server = "HCS-GM0004",
                                  database = "SAM")
con <- odbcDriverConnect(connection = my_con)

# Write data (normally this would come from predict)
predictions <- data.frame(patient_id = c(1,2,3),
                          predicted_readmission = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.4)) %>%
  add_SAM_utility_cols() # if in Health Catalyst environment

sqlSave(con, 
        predictions, 
        "Sepsis.Predictions", 
        append = TRUE, 
        rownames = FALSE)
odbcClose(con)
```

# Full and simplest example code

If you're confused, this is all explained above.
```{r}
library(healthcareai)
library(DBI)
library(RODBC)

# Connection string
my_con <- healthcareai::build_connection_string(server = "HCS-GM0004",
                                                database = "SAM")
con_in <- DBI::dbConnect(odbc::odbc(), .connection_string = my_con)

# Reading
query <- "SELECT
          ,COUNT(*),
          ,year(AdmitDT) as AdmitYear
          FROM [SAM].[Encounter].[PatientEncounterBASE]
          WHERE AdmitYear >= 2013
          GROUP BY AdmitYear
          ORDER BY AdmitYear"

d <- healthcareai::db_read(con_in, query)

# Writing
predictions <- data.frame(patient_id = c(1,2,3),
                          predicted_readmission = c(0.7, 0.2, 0.4))

con_out <- RODBC::odbcDriverConnect(connection = my_con)

RODBC::sqlSave(con_out, 
               predictions, 
               "Sepsis.Predictions", 
               append = TRUE, 
               rownames = FALSE)
DBI::dbDisconnect(con_in)
RODBC::odbcClose(con_out)
```
