\usage{
\method{plot}{explore_df}(x, n_use = 2, aggregate_fun = median,
  reorder_categories = TRUE, x_var, color_var, jitter_y = TRUE,
  sig_fig = 3, font_size = 11, strip_font_size = 0.85, line_width = 0.5,
  line_alpha = 0.7, rotate_x = FALSE, nrows = 1, title = NULL, caption,
  print = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A explore_df object from \code{\link{explore}}}

\item{n_use}{Number of features to vary, default = 4. If the number of
features varied in \code{\link{explore}} is greater than \code{n_use},
additional features will be aggregated over by \code{aggregate_fun}}

\item{aggregate_fun}{Default = median. Varying features in x are mapped to
the x-axis, line color, and vertical- and horizontal facets. If more than
four features vary, this function is used to aggreagate across the
least-important varying features.}

\item{reorder_categories}{If TRUE (default) varying categorical features are
arranged by their median predicted outcome. If FALSE, the incoming level
orders are retained, which is alphabetical by default, but you can set your
own level orders with \code{reorder}}

\item{x_var}{Feature to put on the x-axis (unquoted). If not provided, the
most important feature is used, with numerics prioritized if one varies}

\item{color_var}{Feature to color lines (unquoted). If not provided, the most
important feature excluding \code{x_var} is used.}

\item{jitter_y}{If TRUE (default) and a feature is mapped to color (i.e. if
there is more than one varying feature), the vertical location of the lines
will be jittered slightly (no more than 1% of the range of the outcome) to
avoid overlap.}

\item{sig_fig}{Number of significant figures (digits) to use in labels of
numeric features. Default = 3; set to Inf to not truncate decimals.}

\item{font_size}{Parent font size for the plot. Default = 11}

\item{strip_font_size}{Relative font size for facet strip title font. Default
= 0.85}

\item{line_width}{Width of lines. Default = 0.5}

\item{line_alpha}{Opacity of lines. Default = 0.7}

\item{rotate_x}{If FALSE (default), x axis tick labels are positioned
horizontally. If TRUE, they are rotated one quarter turn, which can be
helpful when a categorical feature with long labels is mapped to x.}

\item{nrows}{Only used when the number of varying features is three. The
number of rows into which the facets will be arranged. Default = 1. NULL
lets the number be determined algorithmically}

\item{title}{Plot title}

\item{caption}{Plot caption. Defaults to model used to make counterfactual
predictions. Can be a string for custom caption or NULL for no caption.}

\item{print}{Print the plot? Default is FALSE. Either way, the plot is
invisibly returned}

\item{...}{Not used}

\examples{
# First, we need a model
set.seed(4956)
m <- machine_learn(pima_diabetes, patient_id, outcome = pregnancies,
                   models = "rf", tune = FALSE)
# Then we can explore our model through counterfactual predictions
counterfactuals <- explore(m)

# By default only the two most important varying features are plotted. This
# example shows how counterfactual predictions can provide insight into how a
# model maps inputs (features) to the output (outcome). This plot shows that for
# this dataset, age is the most important predictor of the number of pregnancies
# a woman has had, and the predicted number of pregnancies rises almost
# perfectly linearly between approximately 20 and 40 before leveling off.
plot(counterfactuals)

# To see the effects of more features in the model, increase the value of
# `n_use`. This plot provides a nice reminder that this function does not assert
# causality. Among low-blood pressure women, obesity is associated with greater
# predicted pregnancies, but it seems more likely that repeated pregnancies
# lead to greater BMI than the reverse.
plot(counterfactuals, n_use = 4)

# You can specify which of the varying features are mapped to the x-axis and
# the color scale
plot(counterfactuals, x_var = diastolic_bp, color_var = skinfold, n_use = 3)

# There are a variety of options available to customize the appearance of the plot
plot(counterfactuals, x_var = weight_class, color = age, n_use = 3,
     font_size = 16, strip_font_size = 1, line_width = 3, line_alpha = .5,
     rotate_x = TRUE, nrows = NULL)

# And you can further modify the plot like any other ggplot object
plot(counterfactuals, n_use = 1) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1,
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "slateblue"),
        plot.caption = element_text(face = "italic"))
