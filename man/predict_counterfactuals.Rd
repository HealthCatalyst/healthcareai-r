\usage{
predict_counterfactuals(models, vary = 4, hold = list(numerics = median,
  characters = Mode), numerics = 5, characters = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A model_list object. The data the model was trained on must
have been prepared, either by training with \code{\link{machine_learn}} or
by preparing with \code{\link{prep_data}} before model training}

\item{vary}{Which (or how many) features to vary? Default is 4; if
\code{vary} is a single integer (n), the n-most-important features are
varied (see Details for how importance is determined). If \code{vary} is a
vector of integers, those rankings of features are used (e.g. \code{vary =
2:4} varies the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th most-important features). Alternatively,
you can specify which features to vary by passing a vector of feature
names. For the finest level of control, you can choose the alternative
values to use by passing a list with names being features names and entries
being values to use; in this case \code{numerics} and \code{characters} are
ignored.}

\item{hold}{How to choose the values of features not being varied? To make
counterfactual predictions for a particular patient, this can be a row of
the training data frame (or a one-row data frame containing values for all
of the non-varying features). Alternatively, this can be functions to
determine the values of non-varying features, in which case it must be a
length-2 list with names "numerics" and "characters", each being a function
to determine the values of non-varying features of that data type. The
default is \code{list(numerics = median, characters = Mode)}; numerics is
applied to the column from the training data, characters is applied to a
frequency table of the column from the training data.}

\item{numerics}{How to determine values of numeric features being varied? By
default, the minimum, 25th-, 50th-, 75th-percentile, and maximum values
from the training dataset will be used. To specify evenly spaced quantiles,
pass an integer to this argument and that number of evenly spaced quantiles
will be used (default = 5). To specify which quantiles to use, pass a
numeric vector in [0, 1] to this argument.}

\item{characters}{Integer. For categorical variables being varied, how many
values to use? Values are used from most- to least-common; default is all
(Inf).}
}
\value{
A tibble with values of features used to make predictions and
  predictions. Has class \code{cf_df} and attribute \code{vi} giving
  information about the varying features.
}
\description{
Make predictions for observations that vary over features of
  interest. There are two major use cases for this function. One is to
  understand how the model responds to features, not just individually but
  over combinations of features (i.e. interaction effects). The other is to
  explore how an individual prediction would vary if feature values were
  different. \strong{Note, however, that this function does not establish
  causality and the latter use case should be deployed judiciously.}
}
\details{
If \code{vary} is an integer, the most important features are
  determined by \code{\link{get_variable_importance}}, unless glm is the only
  model present, in which case \code{\link{interpret}} is used with a
  warning. When selecting the most important features to vary over, for
  categorical features the sum of feature importance of all the levels as
  dummy features is used.

\examples{
# First, we need a model on which to make counterfactual predictions
set.seed(5176)
m <- machine_learn(pima_diabetes, patient_id, outcome = diabetes,
                   tune = FALSE, models = "xgb")

# By default, the four most important features are varied, with numeric
# features taking their 0, 25\%, 50\%, 75\%, and 100\% quantile values. Others are
# held at their median and modal values for numeric and categorical features,
# respectively. This can help to understand how the model responds to different
# features

# You can specify which features vary and what values they take in a variety of
# ways. For example, you could vary only "weight_class" and "plasma_glucose"
predict_counterfactuals(m, vary = c("weight_class", "plasma_glucose"))

# You can also control what values non-varying features take.
# For example, if you want to simulate alternative scenarios for patient 321
patient321 <- dplyr::filter(pima_diabetes, patient_id == 321)

predict_counterfactuals(m, hold = patient321)

# are explicitly specified.
