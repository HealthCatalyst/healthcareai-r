\title{Plot performance of models}
\usage{
\method{plot}{model_list}(x, print = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{modellist object as returned by \code{\link{tune_models}} or
\code{\link{machine_learn}}}

\item{print}{If TRUE (default) plot is printed}

\item{...}{generic compatability}
}
\value{
Plot of model performance as a function of algorithm and
  hyperparameter values tuned over. Generally called for the side effect of
  printing a plot, but the plot is also invisibly returned. The
  best-performing model within each algorithm will be plotted as a triangle.

\examples{
models <- tune_models(mtcars, mpg, models = "knn", tune_depth = 5)
plot(models)
