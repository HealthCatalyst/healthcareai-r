\alias{featureAvailabilityProfiler}
\title{Calculate and plot data availability over time}
\usage{
featureAvailabilityProfiler(df, startDateColumn = "AdmitDTS",
  lastLoadDateColumn = "LastLoadDTS", plotProfiler = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe}

\item{startDateColumn}{Optional string of the column name, representing the 
date of the starting event of interest (e.g., patient admit)}

\item{lastLoadDateColumn}{Optional string of the column name, representing
the date the row was loaded into the final dataset (i.e., via daily ETL)}

\item{plotProfiler}{Default is TRUE. Whether to plot profiler results}
}
\value{
a list, that has as many vectors as columns in the original 
dataframe, with each vector holding the percentage full for each hour
}
\description{
Helps you determine how much data is present in each feature, 
by hour, after a particular event (like patient admit)
}
