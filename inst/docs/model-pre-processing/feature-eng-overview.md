# Overview of pre-processing and feature engineering

## What is feature engineering?

From wikipedia: "Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work."

In other words, while you might have great data, it has to be in a form that the algorithms can use to make a model.

## How can healthcareai help me prepare data prior to model-creation?

* Via [longitudinal imputation](/model-pre-processing/longitudinal-imputation). Think of this as a way to pull person-specific values forward in time.
* Via [seasonality handling](/model-pre-processing/seasonality-handling). Think of this as a way to make a date-time column model-ready.
