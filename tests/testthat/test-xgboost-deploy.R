# The tests in this file all deal with XGBoost deployment, but are separated 
# into two groups
#
# The tests listed under multiclass tests check that the results of XGBoost
# are consistent: running the same code on the same data should yield the same
# results every time. Specifically, the tests check that
#  - the grain column ids are correct
#  - the predicted classes and their order are correct
#  - the probabilities of the predicted classes are correct
#
# The factor level tests are similar to those found in test-factor-level
# -coercion and include:
# 1. Check that single row predictions work
#    - build single row deploy data frame and check that deploy outputs a
#      prediction
#    - note that this implicitly tests that predictions can be made when there
#      are missing factors in one or more columns (for a single row, all but 
#      one level of each factor will be missing)
# 2. Check that predictions are independent
#    - build a single row deploy data set and a data setcontaining all of the 
#      training data, all of which share the same first row
#    - check that the predictions are the same on both data sets for the shared
#      row (i.e. the values taken in other rows of the data have no effect on
#      the prediction)
# 3. Check new factor levels are dealt with correctly
#    - build data sets with new factor levels not seen in develop
#    - check that the correct warning is raised
#    - check that these new levels are treated as NA by comparing the
#      prediction to a prediction made on data with NAs instead of the new 
#      factor levels
# A new test, specific to XGBoost is
# 4. Check that XGBoost behaves the same regardless of whether strings are
#    treated as factors or characters
#    - build a dataset with stringsAsFactors = TRUE
#    - build the same dataset with stringsAsFactors = FALSE
#    - check that the outputs are the same for models trained on both sets
