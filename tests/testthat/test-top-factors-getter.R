# These tests check that the getTopFactors getter function works correctly
# 
# Tests include:
# 1. Checking that the number of factors to output can be specified
# 2. Checking that the weights are correctly ordered
# 3. Checking that the top factors and weights are stable (always have the same
#    values for a fixed data set and seed)
