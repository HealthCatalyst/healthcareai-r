#' Pre-Process High-Cardinality Variables
#' @description pphcv stands for pre-processing of high-cardinality variables. 
#' It is a method to reduce high-cardinality (many categories) variables into 
#' probabilities of the target class or expectations of the target. This allows 
#' the user to utilize variables with large numbers of categories and thus 
#' retain much of the explanatory power of those variables. This 
#' framework can be used in training and testing. If used in training it will 
#' also need to be applied to testing data. Must be used in training in order
#' to be used in testing.
#' 
#' For binary targets, the high-cardinality variable/s will be reduced to 
#' probabilities of the target positive class given each high-cardinality level 
#' otherwise known as the conditional probability, P(Y|X=x).
#' 
#' For continuous targets, the high-cardinality variable/s will be reduced to 
#' expectations of the target variable given each high-cardinality level. Also
#' known as the conditional expectation, E[Y|X=x] 
#' 
#' For multiclass targets with n classes, each high-cardinality variable will be 
#' transformed into n - 1 attributes representing the probability of each target
#' class given each level of the high-cardinality variable. The user may specify
#' the base class.
#' 
#' This technique was taken from a paper titled,"A preprocessing Scheme for High
#' Cardinality Categorical Attributes in Classification and Prediction 
#' Problems," written by Daniele Micci-Barreca, published in ACM SIGKDD 
#' Explorations Newsletter, Volume 3 Issue 1, July 2001, pages 27-32. See
#' references.
#' @param df A data frame that contains the high-cardinality variable/s and an 
#' outcome/target variable of interest.
#' @param high_card The high-cardinality variable/s. Enter as a string or vector
#' of strings, i.e. c("variable1", "variable2", "variable3")
#' @param type What type of variable is the target? Options are "binary",  
#' "continuous", and "multiclass". Enter as a string.
#' @param target The variable target/outcome of interest. Enter as a string. 
#' Only used for training data.
#' @param pos_class If target is binary, what is the positive class? Enter as a 
#' string for a factor or character target and a number for a numeric target.
#' @param m_tuning_param A tuneable parameter that depends on the data domain 
#' and expected noise. If the expected noise is small, m should be small and 
#' vice versa. Defaults to 1. Not used when applying mappings to testing data.
#' @param multi_base If target is multiclass, multi_base gives the option to 
#' specify which class to use as the base category. If not specified the first
#' class will be used as the base level.
#' @param remove_high_card If TRUE, removes the high-cardinality variable from 
#' the final dataframe output. Defaults to FALSE.
#' @param mapping If user wants to do impact coding on testing/deployment data,
#' mapping will use the computed probabilities or expectations from the
#' development step. Only used during testing phase.
#' @return A list that contains the new data frame with the probabilities or 
#' expectations of the high-cardinality variable/s and that also contains the 
#' mappings of each category level.  Mappings are used in deployment/testing.
