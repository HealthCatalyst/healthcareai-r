## Overview

The aim of `healthcareai` is to make machine learning in healthcare as easy as possible. It does that by providing functions to:

- Develop customized, reliable, high-performance machine learning models with minimal code
- Easily make and evaluate predictions and push them to a database or flat file
- Provide tools related to data cleaning, manipulation, imputation, and visualization

**Please note that the package is currently in transition** from an R6 architecture to a tidy, S3 architecture. The code below is the new version, which is in beta and can be acquired via `remotes::install_github("HealthCatalyst/healthcareai-r")`. Beta testing of the new version, pre-CRAN, is very welcome; please file issues for any bugs, unclear docs, or feature suggestions here. `install.packages("healthcareai")` will get you the old version from CRAN, which will remain available via `remotes::install_github("HealthCatalyst/healthcareai-r@v1.2.4")`.

## Example

`healthcareai` can take you from messy data to an optimized model in one line of code:

```{r, message = FALSE}
models <- machine_learn(pima_diabetes, patient_id, outcome = diabetes)
```

Visually inspect the perforance of models:

```{r}
plot(models)
```

Make predictions:

```{r}
predictions <- predict(models)
```

Examine predictive performance:

```{r}
plot(predictions)
```

For details on what's happening under the hood here and for options to customize data preparation and model training, see `vignette("healthcareai")` as well as the helpfiles for individual functions such as `?machine_learn`, `prep_data`, and `tune_models`.
